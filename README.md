# Student-Library-Management-System

This is my 3rd semester Mini Project at Graphic Era Deemed to be University.

*The Library Management has been designed to computerize and automate the operations performed over the information about the members, book issues and returns and all other operations.*

The main aim of this project is to develop a system that can handle and manage the activities involved in a library in an efficient and reliable way. 
It helps in-

-> To do transaction or record more effectively and timesaving.
-> It reduces the risk of paper work such as file lost, file damaged and time consuming.
-> To provide a user-friendly environment.
